# Space!
3D lander game
Character controller refuses to actually be on player and i dont know why
Made randomized terrain cause I thought it would be fun
Yaw is useless but it shows how i was going to do movement at the start.
My main menu was just gone thankfully it was backed up in my sourcetree.
Figured out that for some reason my landers center wasn't at the center of it, it wasn't even on it quick fix thankfully.
Decided to make the fuel spawn randomly on the map hopefully that doesnt let people get past the edge.
Struggled for a while with the fuel bar cause I forgot to put in the actual game object into the script.
Made unity crash cause I was not aware you can't use while loops had to use the initiate function instead.
Changed all the scene changes from index + or - to actual names.
Added a countdown but i couldn't figure out how to make it disappear if you left the ground again so decided to remove it.

About:
Just wanted to make a 3d lander game with randomly generated terrain. 
As for the reason i made it  3d is mostly cause I thought 2d would be boring and i dont really like racing games which is why i made it as the lander.
the game itself is quite simple you just need to land it and keep it on the ground for 5 seconds to win.
it has a fuel system and fuel pickups because i couldn't think of any real power-ups.


Controls;
esc=pause
Space = Thrust
wasd = tilt
q&e = rotate left and right
(technically should work with controller but it has overlapping controls and nothing for thrust)
Start from the menu scene
