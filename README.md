# Space!
3D lander game
Character controller refuses to actually be on player and i dont know why
Made randomized terrain cause I thought it would be fun
Yaw is useless but it shows how i was going to do movement at the start.
My main menu was just gone thankfully it was backed up in my sourcetree.
Figured out that for some reason my landers center wasn't at the center of it wasn't even on it quick fix thankfully.
